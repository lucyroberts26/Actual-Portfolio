					<h2>Projects</h2>
					<p>This page is the portfolio of the projects I created during my technical training week with SpartaGlobal in association with HerCapital. In this week I learned how to code with HTML and CSS. The first few days we worked with just HTML which is where I created the version of YouTube. This page therefore has no proper formatting and is just the basics of coding. Then in the next few days I learned how to code using CSS so learned to change colours and some formats which is how I made the practice portfolio page. Then we learned how to position items on a page so that it was formatted better, this is what the re-creation of YouTube page was used to demonstrate. Finally, we learned how to utilise bootstrap and that was the purpose for creating this whole website.</h3>

							<p>This page was made to show how to layout items. I made a wrapper in the middle and then left and right columns to format the page. I also learned how to change the formatting when the screen width is different and how to get rid of the phone image when it is on a mobile.

							<p>This was the first website we made and was used to test out how to code with HTML. There is no css formatting on this page because it had not been taught yet so this purely shows how HTML works. I made my own version of youtube with videos and links to videos with a screen capturer to play the video. To view the code for this project, please press the link to my github below..</p>
